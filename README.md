## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-

### What I learned

I have a gained little grasb on how to design the mobile first approach to a responsive design.

Below is some code im proud of:

```css
body {
	font-size: 14px;
	font-family: var(--font-family);
	background-color: var(--grey-900);
	color: white;
	min-height: 100vh;
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	flex-direction: column;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 1rem;
}
```

```css
width: 90%;
max-width: 375px;
```

### Continued development

**Areas to improve:**

- **Advanced Media Queries** - Need to practice more complex breakpoint strategies and container queries
- **CSS Grid** - Want to explore grid layouts for more complex card arrangements
- **Hover/Focus States** - Need to add interactive states for better accessibility
- **Typography Scale** - Learn to create more systematic font sizing across breakpoints
- **Performance** - Optimize font loading and reduce CSS redundancy
- **Accessibility** - Improve semantic HTML and ARIA attributesreplace with your own plans for continued development.\*\*
